Instagram Downloader
==========================

A very small, basic extension for Firefox that allows you to quickly view/download full-size images from Instagram via a context menu option ("Download from Instagram") that appears when you right-click (or Ctrl/Cmd+click) on an image.

"**Why?**" you ask? Because Instagram itself provides no easy way to do this.
